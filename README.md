# Project: Movie Trailer Website

## Project for Fullstack Nanodegree program at [Udacity.com](http://www.udacity.com "Udacity.com")

Server-side code is written in Python to display a webpage of movies that show
the movie title, the year the movie was released, and a movie poster of that particular movie. In addition, when the movie poster is clicked, a modal window will appear that plays the movie trailer.

A live site example of this code can be found here: ["Movie Trailer Website"](https://junclemente.github.io/movie_trailer/fresh_tomatoes).

### How to use

Download this [repository](https://github.com/junclemente/movie_trailer) onto your computer. 
To run the program, you must first create the html page.
Do this by typing the following in the console: 
`$ python entertainment_center.py`

Once that has completed, it should automatically open up the newly created
`fresh_tomatoes.html` in a browser. You can also manually open up the html file
once it has been created. 

### Customize the movies

To customize the movies and the information shown, read the comments in
`entertainment_center.py` and make any changes within that file. This is the only file you will need to edit. Once you've completed your changes, you must run the program again by typing the following in the console: 
`$ python entertainment_center.py`
This will create a new html page with the changes you made.
